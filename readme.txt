YAROID

What is Yaroid?
     Yaroid is a NetYaroze asteroid-like game.  It is based after a simple
asteroid game I created for the 286.  Although it is currently playable,
the game play needs to be tweaked because it is too easy and doesn't get
harder over time.  If you any questions about Yaroid please email
Dennis Payne (dulsi@identicalsoftware.com) or check the Yaroid web site at

How to play
     Included is an auto file for loading the game.  (See Sony
documentation for loading programs into the Net Yaroze.)  Once started
you have three choices "Start Game", "Options", and "Exit Game".  Use
select to change the current choice and press start to activate the
choice.  Options toggles between the new graphics and the "classic" mode.
Exit game simply exits the program.  Start game allows you to play the
game.
     Once the game is started.  The square button fires.  Up activates
thrust.  Left and right spin the ship.  Down activates hyperspace.  Your
score is shown at the top left.  Remaining lives are displayed on the
top right.

Source Code
     As mentioned earlier Yaroid is ported from a DOS/Linux program.  The
port was done quickly and has left the code in a poor state.  I'm not sure
when I'll be able to clean up the source code so I'm releasing it as is.
The supplied makefile is for my linux machine with the net yaroze
cross-compiler and will require some modification.  The source code is
made available under the GNU GPL (see COPYING file for more info).

To Do
* Clean up source code.
* Improve difficulty and game play.
* Improve some of the graphics such as the ship.
* Add sound.
* Add shield and flip capabilities.
* Add two players.
* Add ufo.
